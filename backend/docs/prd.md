Project Name: PR Review Agent
Duration: 12 Hours
Objective: Build an AI-powered agent that reviews pull requests across any git server, analyzing code changes and providing actionable feedback. The system should work with multiple git servers, understand diverse codebases, and provide suggestions for code quality, standards, and potential bugs.

Key Features
Mandatory Requirements

Multi-Git Server Compatibility

Ability to fetch PRs from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket (and potentially others).

Support authentication via OAuth or personal access tokens.

Code Review Analysis

Analyze added, removed, or modified lines in a PR.

Evaluate code structure, coding standards, best practices, and possible bugs.

Modular Python Architecture

Clean, modular structure:

fetch_pr.py → Connects to Git servers and fetches PR data.

analyze_code.py → Runs code analysis and quality checks.

generate_feedback.py → Uses AI to generate review feedback.

database.py → Stores PR information, code metadata, and analysis results.

Enhancements

AI-Driven Feedback

Use LangChain + LangGraph with Gemini API for:

Summarizing PR changes.

Suggesting improvements for readability, performance, and security.

Detecting potential bugs and anti-patterns.

Inline Review Comments

Simulate GitHub/GitLab inline comments.

Attach feedback to specific code lines.

CI/CD Integration

Allow pre-merge automatic code review in CI/CD pipelines.

Optional webhook integration.

Code Quality Scoring

Provide a score/grade for PR based on metrics like:

Code complexity

Test coverage

Code standards adherence

Technical Architecture
1. System Components

Git Server Adapter Module

Handles communication with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket APIs.

Converts PR data into a common internal format for analysis.

AI Review Engine

Powered by LangChain + LangGraph with Gemini API.

Reads the PR diff and generates suggestions.

Outputs structured feedback with line references.

Graph Database

Store PRs, code structure, dependencies, and feedback in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j).

Enables querying code relationships, detecting anti-patterns, and tracking historical PR data.

Feedback Formatter

Converts AI output into inline review comments.

Optional JSON output for CI/CD integration.

2. Data Flow

Fetch PR

Adapter module fetches PR data from the specified git server.

Process PR Diff

Extracts modified files and line-level changes.

Graph Database Storage

Represents code structure as nodes and relationships:

Nodes: functions, classes, modules

Edges: function calls, inheritance, dependencies

AI Analysis

LangChain queries the graph database using LangGraph with Gemini API.

Generates feedback:

Code quality

Potential bugs

Refactoring suggestions

Feedback Output

Inline comments

Overall PR score

AI Integration Details

LangChain: Handles LLM queries and contextual reasoning about code.

LangGraph: Structures PR and code relationships in a graph format for reasoning.

Gemini API: Used as the LLM backend to generate human-like suggestions.

Graph Queries:

Identify unused code, repeated patterns, complex dependencies.

Detect potential vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.
